## CCOFOG and Macroeconomic Indicators

This repository includes the **Canadian Classification of the Functions of Government (CCOFOG)** and **Macroeconomic Indicators** datasets, both sourced from Statistics Canada. These datasets share the same time coverage, frequency, and number of observations.  
- **CCOFOG** describes government expenditures by final use, structured into three hierarchical levels:  
  - **Division** (first three digits) – highest level  
  - **Group** (four digits) – subgroup within a division  
  - **Class** (five digits) – specific category within a group  

- **Macroeconomic Indicators** capture the overall state of the economy, including measures such as:  
  - Gini coefficient  
  - Unemployment rate  
  - Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  
  - Median after-tax income  
  - Consumer price indexes  

**Dataset details:**  
- **Period covered:** 2008 – 2023  
- **Frequency:** Annual  
- **Number of observations:** 160 province-year (10 provinces × 16 years)
