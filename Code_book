I. Macroeconomic Indicators
	1. Gini coefficient - adjusted after-tax income
		> A number between zero and one that measures the relative 
			degree of inequality in the distribution of income. The coefficient would 
			register zero (minimum inequality) for a population in which each person 
			received exactly the same adjusted household income and it would register 
			a coefficient of one (maximum inequality) if one person received all the 
			adjusted household income and the rest received none. Even though a single 
			Gini coefficient value has no simple interpretation, comparisons of the 
			level over time or between populations are very straightforward: the 
			higher the coefficient, the higher the inequality of the distribution.

	2. Unemployment rate - among those aged 15 years and over
		> The number of unemployed persons expressed as a percentage 
			of the labour force. The unemployment rate for a particular group (age, 
			gender, marital status, etc.) is the number unemployed in that group 
			expressed as a percentage of the labour force for that group.
	3. Median after-tax income (in 2023 constant dollars)

	4. Gross domestic product (GDP) - at market prices (in 1,000,000 dollars)

	5. Consumer price index (CPI) - all items (in 2002 constant dollars)

	6. Consumer price index (CPI) - general governments final consumption expenditure (in 2017 constant dollars)
