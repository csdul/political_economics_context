# Node 1 - Political Economic Context

Statistics Canada has reissued what was historically known as its Consolidated Government Revenue and Expenditures tables, bringing them in line with international government revenue and spending practices and adding a great deal more granularity in the areas of health and social spending. At the same time, it has stopped reporting government finances in the way that it has in the past. The new system used for classifying areas of spending is called the Canadian Classification of Functions of Government [(CCOFOG)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/statistical-programs/document/5218_D3_V3)[^1]. [Dr. Daniel Dutton](https://medicine.dal.ca/departments/department-sites/community-health/our-people/our-faculty/daniel-dutton.html) will lead efforts to update and replicate past work by himself and his colleagues[^2] associating government spending on health and social protection, and health outcomes among the Canadian provinces. In the process, he will create a simplified version of the data and set of guidelines that will be included in CSDUL. The data will span at least the 2008 to 2018 time period. As he did previously, Dutton will also identify and include relevant macro-level controls from Statistics Canada The Daily Indicators series (e.g., Gini, GDP, and the unemployment rate). The work of replicating his past work with the new spending data will be used to validate the new data.
